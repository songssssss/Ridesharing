â€“ Ridesharing System

Implement a system for a ridesharing startup company. It manages data relevant to ridesharing, e.g., drivers, passengers, vehicles, requests, taxi stops, and trips. The system should provide an interactive interface to system administrators, passengers, managers, and drivers.

This project is divided into two phases:
In phase 1, design the database (including an ER-diagram and a relational schema). Use the suggested solution to complete phase 2.

In phase 2, implement the system as a Java command-line program.
