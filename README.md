â€“ Ridesharing System

You are required to implement a system for a ridesharing startup company. It manages data relevant to ridesharing, e.g., drivers, passengers, vehicles, requests, taxi stops, and trips. The system should provide an interactive interface to system administrators, passengers, managers, and drivers.

This project is divided into two phases:
In phase 1, you have to design the database (including an ER-diagram and a relational schema). A suggested solution will be provided after phase 1. You are required to use the suggested solution to complete phase 2.

In phase 2, you are required to implement the system as a Java command-line program.
